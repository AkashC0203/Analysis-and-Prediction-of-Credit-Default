# Analysis and Prediction of Credit Default

## Introduction
This project explores the analysis and prediction of credit defaults using machine learning models on a dataset of Taiwanese credit card clients. Our goal is to accurately predict credit default based on a range of attributes including demographic information and historical payment data.

## Dataset
- `Credit_card_datasets`: Contains pre-partitioned training and test datasets for model training and evaluation.

## Jupyter Notebook
- `Credit_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Contains the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.

## Installation
To set up this project, ensure you have Python installed and follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AkashC0203/Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Credit-Default.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Credit-Default

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the analysis and prediction models, open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
# Open the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Credit_Data_Analysis.ipynb
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the data analysis and model predictions.
```
